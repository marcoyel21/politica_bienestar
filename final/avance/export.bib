   abstract = {In 2013 the Mexican Telecommunications and Broadcasting Reform was launched with the goal of promoting competition and access in the telecommunications sector. The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether the 2013 reform had an impact on household fixed internet adoption and to what extent Mexican households, classified into ten wealth groups, had adopted internet. For the assessment, after a revision of supply and demand Reform's measures to reduce the digital divide, data from the 2010 Census and 2015 Intercensal Survey were used to create adoption indexes using Poisson estimations. The results were analyzed by ten wealth groups, constructed on principal components based on household characteristics (type of dwelling, electricity availability, availability of drinking water, sewer system, internet and ICT devices: computer, telephone, cell phone and internet). Additionally, the impact of both indexes was validated by a difference in differences method. The results suggest a 66% overall increase in internet adoption between 2010 and 2015. The decile analysis showed considerable internet adoption in the low and middle wealth groups (deciles 2–8), while in the highest wealth groups (deciles 9–10) the impact of internet adoption has been relatively moderate. It is worth noting that internet adoption is unequally distributed, as less than 1% of households in deciles 1 to 6 had adopted internet in 2015, while nearly all of the wealthiest ten percent of households have internet access. Nevertheless the increment in internet adoption was not only the result of the reform but the combination of the broadband penetration trend and the reform together.},

   abstract = {This paper analyzes to what extend the local presence of very high-speed broadband networks has a causal impact on the creation of new businesses and sole proprietorships. Estimations are performed using micro-level panel data covering almost 5000 municipalities in metropolitan France, from 2010 to 2015. A count modeling approach with time- and municipal-fixed effects is first developed. It shows heterogeneous effects across sectors. Municipalities with a very high-speed broadband network tend to be more attractive for companies, with a positive effect on establishment creation within the tertiary sector and the construction sector. In addition, these municipalities seem to provide a more favorable environment for entrepreneurship. However, the benefits of very high-speed broadband are not equally distributed across municipalities and depend on the educational attainment of the population.},

   abstract = {This paper provides experimental evidence for the impact of home internet access on a broad range of child outcomes in Peru. We compare children who were randomly chosen to receive laptops with high-speed internet access to (i) those who did not receive laptops and (ii) those who only received laptops without internet. We find that providing free internet access led to improved computer and internet proficiency relative to those without laptops and improved internet proficiency compared to those with laptops only. However, there were no significant effects of internet access on math and reading achievement, cognitive skills, self-esteem, teacher perceptions, or school grades when compared to either group. We explore reasons for the absence of impacts on these key outcomes with survey questions, time-diaries, and computer logs.},

   abstract = {To identify the competitive effect of online competition, I exploit that consumers in some German municipalities lack broadband access due to legacy glass fibre cables. In these areas with reduced online competition, I find that offline employment in electronics retailing grows faster than in the control areas. I find no such differential for food retailing, where there is no online competition. Full broadband access reduces employment growth in electronics relative to food retailing by 1.1% per year from 1999 to 2007. I find no significant effect for book retailing, which is shielded from retail price competition by law.},

@report{Belo2013,
   abstract = {This paper looks at the effects of providing broadband to schools on students' performance. We use a rich panel of data on broadband use and students' grades from all middle schools in Portugal. Employing a first-differences specification to control for school-specific unobserved effects, and instrumenting the quality of broadband to account for unobserved time-varying effects, we show that high levels of broadband use in schools are detrimental for grades in the 9 th grade national exams. For the average broadband use in schools, grades reduce 0.78 of a standard deviation, from 2005 to 2009. We also show that broadband has a negative impact on exam scores regardless of gender, subject or school quality, and that the way schools allow students to use the Internet affects their performance. In particular, students in schools that block access to websites such as YouTube perform relatively better.},

   abstract = {Does differential access to computer technology at home compound the educational disparities between rich and poor? Would a program of government provision of computers to early secondary school students reduce these disparities? We use administrative data on North Carolina public school students to corroborate earlier surveys that document broad racial and socioeconomic gaps in home computer access and use. Using within-student variation in home computer access, and across-ZIP code variation in the timing of the introduction of high-speed internet service, we also demonstrate that the introduction of home computer technology is associated with modest but statistically significant and persistent negative impacts on student math and reading test scores. Further evidence suggests that providing universal access to home computers and high-speed internet access would broaden, rather than narrow, math and reading achievement gaps.},

   abstract = {Does the availability of mobile broadband internet affect children's test scores? We compare Portuguese and math scores before and after the staggered entry of 3G into Brazil's 5,570 municipalities using an event study design. We find that there is no effect of mobile internet on test scores, and can reject effect sizes of 0.02 standard deviations in both math and Portuguese. Taken together, our results indicate that simply offering high-speed mobile internet is not sufficient to improve educational outcomes. * We would like to thank David Atkin, Esther Duflo, Basil Halperin, Ofer Malamud, Charlie Rafkin and participants in MIT's Development Tea for insightful comments.
