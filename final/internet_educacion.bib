abstract = {This paper analyzes to what extend the local presence of very high-speed broadband networks has a causal impact on the creation of new businesses and sole proprietorships. Estimations are performed using micro-level panel data covering almost 5000 municipalities in metropolitan France, from 2010 to 2015. A count modeling approach with time- and municipal-fixed effects is first developed. It shows heterogeneous effects across sectors. Municipalities with a very high-speed broadband network tend to be more attractive for companies, with a positive effect on establishment creation within the tertiary sector and the construction sector. In addition, these municipalities seem to provide a more favorable environment for entrepreneurship. However, the benefits of very high-speed broadband are not equally distributed across municipalities and depend on the educational attainment of the population.},

Primero, el desempe{\&}{\#}xf1;o del sector, que si bien ha mejorado se mantiene por debajo de las metas alcanzables. Segundo, las causas del d{\&}{\#}xe9;ficit de desempe{\&}{\#}xf1;o son la competencia insuficiente y la regulaci{\&}{\#}xf3;n ineficaz. El presente art{\&}{\#}xed;culo se enfoca en dos cuestiones. La primera es el desempe{\&}{\#}xf1;o relativo de la industria de las telecomunicaciones en M{\&}{\#}xe9;xico. La segunda es si la regulaci{\&}{\#}xf3;n de las telecomunicaciones en M{\&}{\#}xe9;xico se aparta o no de las mejores pr{\&}{\#}xe1;cticas internacionales y si las recomendaciones de la OCDE son o no sensatas. Las principales conclusiones del presente art{\&}{\#}xed;culo son las siguientes. En cuanto al desempe{\&}{\#}xf1;o, el an{\&}{\#}xe1;lisis de la OCDE es correcto en t{\&}{\#}xe9;rminos generales y las cr{\&}{\#}xed;ticas al estudio de la OCDE que hacen Hausman y Ros son mayormente infundadas.

The recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Mexican telecommunications (OECD, 2012a) makes two main points. First, the performance of the sector, while improved, remains below attainable goals. Second, the causes of the performance deficit are insufficient competition and ineffective regulation. This article focuses on two issues. The first is the relative performance of the telecommunications industry in Mexico. The second is whether Mexican telecommunications regulation departs from international best practice, and whether the OECD's recommendations make sense. The principal conclusion of this article with respect to performance is that the OECD's analysis generally is correct and the criticisms of the OECD report by Hausman and Ros are, for the most part, misplaced. With respect to policy, the OECD's analysis of Mexican regulation reflects the conclusions from scholarly research and the practices of peer nations in which the performance of the telecommunications industry is better than in Mexico.},

abstract = {Using data from Mexico's 2016 National Household Income and Expenditure Survey (ENIGH), we estimate the impact of Internet access on the multidimensional and income poverty of rural and urban Mexico. Based on a Propensity Score Matching approach, our results show that Internet access helps reduce poverty levels in Mexico. Findings also reveal differentiated effects in the two indicators accounting for greater deprivation. The impacts on reducing extreme income poverty and extreme multidimensional poverty are more significant for the rural sector than for the urban sector. The results suggest policy measures aimed at solving issues that limit Internet access for individuals and households with higher social vulnerability, thereby contributing to a reduction of the poverty levels experienced by an important segment of Mexico's population.},

abstract = {Research on the effects of home Internet use on children's academic performance is virtually nonexistent. Although parents believe that having the Internet at home is important to their children's success in school, evidence linking access to success is lacking. In the HomeNetToo project we automatically recorded the actual Internet use of 130 children (mean age=13) from low-income families for 16 months. Most of the children were African American (83{\%}) and male (58{\%}), and all resided in a mid-size urban community in the United States. Results indicated that Internet use predicted both grade point averages (GPAs) and standardized test scores. In general, the more frequently children used the Internet at home, the better their GPAs and standardized test scores. Implications for efforts to reduce the digital divide and facilitate access to technology for all children are discussed.},

We find that providing free internet access led to improved computer and internet proficiency relative to those without laptops and improved internet proficiency compared to those with laptops only. However, there were no significant effects of internet access on math and reading achievement, cognitive skills, self-esteem, teacher perceptions, or school grades when compared to either group.

abstract = {In 2013 the Mexican Telecommunications and Broadcasting Reform was launched with the goal of promoting competition and access in the telecommunications sector. The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether the 2013 reform had an impact on household fixed internet adoption and to what extent Mexican households, classified into ten wealth groups, had adopted internet. For the assessment, after a revision of supply and demand Reform's measures to reduce the digital divide, data from the 2010 Census and 2015 Intercensal Survey were used to create adoption indexes using Poisson estimations. The results were analyzed by ten wealth groups, constructed on principal components based on household characteristics (type of dwelling, electricity availability, availability of drinking water, sewer system, internet and ICT devices: computer, telephone, cell phone and internet). Additionally, the impact of both indexes was validated by a difference in differences method. The results suggest a 66{\%} overall increase in internet adoption between 2010 and 2015. The decile analysis showed considerable internet adoption in the low and middle wealth groups (deciles 2–8), while in the highest wealth groups (deciles 9–10) the impact of internet adoption has been relatively moderate. It is worth noting that internet adoption is unequally distributed, as less than 1{\%} of households in deciles 1 to 6 had adopted internet in 2015, while nearly all of the wealthiest ten percent of households have internet access. Nevertheless the increment in internet adoption was not only the result of the reform but the combination of the broadband penetration trend and the reform together.},

Would a program of government provision of computers to early secondary school students reduce these disparities? We use administrative data on North Carolina public school students to corroborate earlier surveys that document broad racial and socioeconomic gaps in home computer access and use. Using within-student variation in home computer access, and across-ZIP code variation in the timing of the introduction of high-speed internet service, we also demonstrate that the introduction of home computer technology is associated with modest but statistically significant and persistent negative impacts on student math and reading test scores. Further evidence suggests that providing universal access to home computers and high-speed internet access would broaden, rather than narrow, math and reading achievement gaps.},

Out of the 375 questionnaires distributed, 200 were dully responded to and returned to the researcher. Data collected were analysed using inferential statistics, frequency table and percentage. The findings revealed that Internet is one of the beneficial tools in this era of IT not only for business but for academic point of view and enhances the skill and capability of students which assist them in studies and professional life. It also revealed that some of the problem encountered in the usage of Internet includes lack of computer skills, slow internet server and problem of paying for online services. The study recommends that the university should embark on Information literacy/sensitization programme for student's in order to effectively harness the various web based electronic resources it is subscribed to.},
